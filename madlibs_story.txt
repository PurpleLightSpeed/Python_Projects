Today I went to the zoo with my <adjective> friend <name>. We saw a <adjective> <animal> jumping up and down in its tree. It <verb_past_tense> <adverb> through the large tunnel that led to its <adjective> habitat.

We also saw a <color> <animal> that <verb_past_tense> as soon as it saw us. I was so <emotion> that I <verb_past_tense> my <object> all over the ground.

Later, we ate some <plural_noun> and drank a bottle of <liquid>. My favorite part was when a <adjective> <animal> tried to steal my <object>!

It was a really <adjective> day, and I canâ€™t wait to <verb> again soon.
